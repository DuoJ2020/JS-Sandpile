# JS-SandPile

The JS_Sandpiles app is a simple JavaScript implementation of the [Abelian sandpile model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model).

The app contains a few tiling presets such as Square and Hexagonal grid, or Penrose tilings, and can extend to arbitrary graph.

Feel free to contact us for any additional information.
